# Name
Lucia Kiio

# Origin
I am originally from Kenya and currently based in the United States.

# Research Interests
-I'm investigating the intersection of nutrition, immunology, and infectious disease, with a particular focus on how dietary interventions can modulate disease outcomes in viral infections. My current work examines the role of resistant starch in regulating immune responses and gut microbiota during dengue infection, using murine models to explore the complex relationships between diet, microbiome-derived metabolites, and disease severity. Beyond this, my research interests span virology and infectious diseases, biosensor development for electrochemical detection, and biomarker discovery, all unified by a commitment to translating fundamental science into practical diagnostic and therapeutic solutions
# Personal Interests
- I'm passionate about leveraging computational approaches to make sense of complex biological data, and I actively develop bioinformatics workflows and data analysis tools that bridge wet-lab research with digital innovation. Outside the lab, I find deep fulfillment in teaching and mentoring the next generation of scientists, engaging in community service initiatives, and continuously exploring emerging technologies that can advance both research capabilities and public health impact.
# Fun Facts about me
I enjoy combining science with real-world problem-solving, especially in public health.
